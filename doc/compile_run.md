## Compilation
Since Version 5.4, Extpar is built with an autotool based build-system. This has been necessary to accomodate for the additional C source code files and newly required libraries.

There are three options to compile Extpar: 

#### In-source build
./configure.*hostname.compiler*  
source modules.env  
make   

#### Out-of-source build
mkdir build-*my_self_defined_note*  
cd build-*my_self_defined_note*  
*path_to_the_extpar_installation*/configure.*hostname.compiler*  
source modules.env  
make  

#### Install binaries only in external directory
./configure.*hostname.compiler* --prefix=*my_external_directory*  
source modules.env  
make install  
The binaries will be installed in  *my_external_directory/bin*

#### Restart build from scratch
make distclean 

#### Configure for new machines
The first step in creating a new machine setup is to take one of
the existing configure wrapper scripts and adapt it to your local
environment. The scripts are called configure.*hostname.compiler*.

## Run
The Fortran executables 
*   *extpar_aot_to_buffer.exe*
*   *extpar_landuse_to_buffer.exe*
*   *extpar_topo_to_buffer.exe*
*   *extpar_flake_to_buffer.exe*  

can simply be copied to the run-directory.
 
The main python scripts 
*   *extpar_alb_to_buffer.py*
*   *extpar_cru_to_buffer.py*
*   *extpar_ndvi_to_buffer.py*
*   *extpar_emiss_to_buffer.py*
*   *exptar_era_to_buffer.py*
*   *extpar_ahf_to_buffer.py*
*   *extpar_isa_to_buffer.py*  

can be treated like the Fortran binaries and copied to the run-directory. Make sure the *namelist.py* is also present at the run-directory.  

All self-written Python-modules are stored in [lib](../python/lib) and do not need to be copied to the respective run-directory, rather the environment variable **PYTHONPATH** needs to be set to the following:  
 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:*absolute_path_to_python/lib*

Some runscript examples are available under /run_scripts.
Just adapt them to your needs!

### Check
1. that you haven't got any error message at runtime,
2. that you got a file in NetCDF format (.nc), and
3. in case of use with cosmo that Int2lm is able to read these 2 files
