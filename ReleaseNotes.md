# Release notes
## 5.4.2
This is an intermediate release that brings enhanced namelist parsing for the Python-CDO scripts, a new Python-CDO script *extpar_era_to_buffer.py* to replace
the former way of remapping ERA-climatologies using Icontools, a more sophisticated tolerance checker to allow specific roundoff for each test and variables, support and new default NetCDF 5, fixes for high-resolution grid exceeding integer value range and some minor bugfixes for Piz Daint related to HDF5.  
* exptar_era_to_buffer  
   - 4 fields processed
      - Sea surface temperature (T_SEA)
      - 2m land temperature (T_2M_CLIM)
      - Geometric height (TOPO_CLIM)
      - Snow water equivalent (W_SNOW)
   - New namelist-parameter iera_type defines type of ERA input data used, either ERA-I or ERA-5
   - *extpar_consistency_check* checks for namelist *INPUT_ERA* to determine if ERA-climatologies come from Python-CDO or Icontools
   - Using *extpar_era_to_buffer.py* changes fields, a detailed [review of changes](https://github.com/C2SM-RCM/extpar/wiki/Comparison-of-ERA-Interim-processing-using-ICON-REMAP-and-Python-CDO) was performed by JÃ¼rgen Helmert from DWD
      - W_SNOW
      - TOPO_CLIM
      - T_SEA

* HORIZON and SKYVIEW fields for the Icon grid
   - 4 new namelist-parameter
      - radius -> defines the considered horizontal distance for the HORIZON field
      - min_circ_cov -> defines the level of detail of the search-algorithm for performance reasons
      - max_missing -> defines upper treshold for the allowed missingness at the boundary of the domain
      - itype_scaling -> choose the type of scaling for SKYVIEW to account for anisotropic behaviour of IR-radiation

## 5.4
This is a major release that introduces a rewrite of 4 Extpar programmes in Python, a common git-LFS input data repository,
a new build-system, 2 additional landuse data sets, CDI-library for icon grids in consistency check, mmap-caching for consistency check for less memory usage, some small improvements in the Fortran code and some minor changes in the testsuite.

* Rewrite of 4 Extpar programmes in Python
   - Modules extpar_alb_to_buffer.py, extpar_cru_to_buffer.py, extpar_emiss_to_buffer.py and extpar_ndvi_to_buffer.py
   - Small changes of the fields compared to the former Fortran implementation due to different interpolation methods, especially at the coastlines
   - Fields changed:
      - NDVI, NDVI_MAX, NDVI_MRAT
      - ALB_SAT, ALB_DRY
      - ALB, ALUVD, ALNID
      - T_CL
      - EMISS_RAD
   - A [review](https://github.com/C2SM-RCM/extpar/wiki/Review-of-fields-for-Extpar-Version-5.4) involving users from DWD, MCH, MPIM and ETH took place to ensure the correctness of all fields changed
   - All Python programmes read from the same namelist file *namelist.py* containing Python dictionaries for each Extpar program.
   - Support of the old and coarse data (it_cl_type = 2) in extpar_cru_to_buffer expires and is replaced the following:
      - it_cl_type = 2 aggregates the coarse data over sea **and** the fine data over land
      - it_cl_type = 1 aggregates the fine data over land, sea points are not considered
      - For aggregation of the coarse data over land and sea only, use Extpar 5.3 or older
      
   - Read the [users guide](doc/user_and_implementation_manual.pdf) for detailed information about the rewritten programmes.
   
* git-LFS input data repository
   - All input data that can be processed with Extpar is stored in a unified data repository [extpar-input-data](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/extpar-data/extpar-input-data)
   - Move all useful scripts and informations from raw_data_tools to the data repository hosted at DKRZ.
   - Remove folder raw_data_tools from Extpar repository
   - Some fields are renamed for better understanding, so please check your runscripts to adapt the new names.

 ### Changes in Results
  Due to the large amount of changes in the code in this release, there are many differences in the resulting external parameter fields generated by the release 5.0 code compared to the fields generated by older Extpar codes.  The only code change in this release that deliberately changed the results was the addition of a lower limit for roughness length, which is 1e-6.  Otherwise, any changes in results that can be seen came directly from bug fixes to the code, and as such most of them are small and are not expected to change results in the COSMO or ICON model runs.  Some of these changes in results are examined in the next two sections.  

 #### Extpar version 4.0 to Extpar version 5.0
  The technical testsuite in Extpar was used to compare the external parameter fields from Version 4.0 and Version 5.0 for three different MeteoSwiss operational setups for COSMO and a climate setup for COSMO-CLM.  

 ##### COSMO 7, globe topography input
  For the COSMO7 MCH setup using the globe topography data set, changes in the results smaller than 1e-6 can be seen for several variables, including the aerosol variables, albedo variables, HORIZON, and SSO_SIGMA.  Larger changes on the order of 3 degrees can be seen in the SSO_THETA variable;  these are due to a bug fix in this release, and are expected.  Finally, roughness length is different as well due to the introduction of the lower limit value of 1e-6.  

 ##### COSMO 7, aster topography input
  For the COSMO7 MCH setup using  the aster topography data set, the changes in the results are less than 5e-7, and occur in the aerosol, HORIZON, and SSO_SIGMA variables.  

 ##### COSMO 1, aster topography input
  For the COSMO1 MCH setup using the aster topography data set, the changes in the results are less than 4e-5, and occur in the aerosol, HORIZON, SKYVIEW, and T_CL variables.  

 ##### COSMO-CM climate setup
  For the COSMO-CLM climate setup using the globe topography data set, changes in results smaller than 3e-8 can be seen in the SSO_SIGMA and SSO_STDH variables.  Larger changes on the order of 3 degrees can be seen in the SSO_THETA variable;  these are due to a bug fix in this release, and are expected.  Due to another bug fix, the ALB_SAT and ALB_DRY variables have changed results on the order of .2.  Finally, roughness length is different as well due to the introduction of the lower limit value of 1e-6.  

 #### DWD Extpar version 2.10 to Extpar version 5.0
  Comparisons of the COSMO D2 setup used operationally by DWD were carried out to compare the current operational Extpar code (DWD version 2.10) with the new release 5.0.  This comparison showed no significant differences in the generated external parameter fields.  Get more details of this comparison [here](doc/EXTPAR_CD2_comparison.pdf)
