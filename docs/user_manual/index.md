This short overview of the **EXTPAR** software describes the working
environment and the necessary steps to generate external parameters for
numerical weather prediction and climate applications. More detailed
information on specific modules of EXTPAR can be found in the technical
and scientific documentation.

For the sake of completeness, the latest EXTPAR documentation (v5.14),
which was created from the original LaTeX file, can be downloaded
[here](EXTPAR_User_Manual_5_14.pdf).
